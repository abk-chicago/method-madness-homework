# Method Madness Homework

Practice writing methods that return data and are void!

## Get Started

1. Fork this repository
2. Clone it to your computer
3. Open the project in IntelliJ 
4. Create a new `src` directory and create a `Madness.java` class inside of the project.

Inside of your `Madness.java`, you'll need to write various methods. These methods should be defined inside of your `Madness` class below your `main` method. Some of these will return data; some _may not_. Complete as many as you can until your eyes bleed and then push your changes (sync/publish/push) and then create a _pull request_ to submit your homework.

>> **Hint** You may need to research the `Math` class for help with this assignment.

## Method Madness

1. Define a function `maxOfTwoNumbers` that takes two numbers as arguments and returns the largest of them. I would suggest using conditional statements. Do some Googling to figure this out if you forget how conditionals work.
2. Define a function `maxOfThree` that takes three numbers as arguments and returns the largest of them.
3. Write a function `isCharacterAVowel` that takes a character (i.e. a string of length 1) and returns true if it is a vowel, false otherwise.
4. Write a function that return the number of arguments passed to the function when called.
5. Define a function `reverseString` that computes the reversal of a string. For example, reverseString("jag testar") should return the string "ratset gaj".
6. _Bonus_: Write a function `findLongestWord` that takes an array of words and returns the length of the longest one.
7. _Bonus_: Write a function `filterLongWords` that takes an array of words and a number `i` and returns the array of words that are longer than i characters long.
8. _Bonus_: Create a class, Car, that has the following member variables: mTopSpeed and mNumberOfDoors. In that class, write a constructor method that assigns random values to the member variables. Also, write a method that prints out the line "Your car has the top speed of ___ mph, and for some reason has ____ doors."
